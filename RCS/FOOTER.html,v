This is the public_html directory of BlinkenShell user lam nickname LAMurakami.
<p>
The ability to post personal web pages at BlinkenShell
 is included in the Free Shell Accounts they offer.

Free Shell Accounts</a></b> have a 100 MB Disk Quota and

<b><a href="http://blinkenshell.org/wiki/Info/Supporter"
 title="More details on Supporter accounts">

Supporter</a></b> Accounts have a 1 GB quota.

<p>
If you have a BlinkenShell Account you have read access to the DocumentRoot of this website at
~lam/public_html or /home/lam/public_html including the HEADER.html FOOTER.html and .htaccess files which are not listed in the above directory listing.  You also have access to the hidden RCS directory and rcs archives within.  The rcs command was not installed in my default path on triton when I got on and you can also access the rcs commands, info and help I built.  To do so you would modify your environment with the following:
<pre>PATH=${PATH}:~lam/bin ; export PATH
MANPATH=${MANPATH}:~lam/share/man ; export MANPATH
INFOPATH=${INFOPATH}:~lam/share/info ; export INFOPATH</pre>

Once you have executed the above you can access the commands and the documentation.  The rcs command has both a man page and info file that can be accessed with:
<pre>info rcs
man rcs</pre>

If you want to see the output of the wget, tar, configure, make, and make install commands used to install rcs from source you can look at on triton it with:
<pre>less ~lam/src/rcs-5.9.4/wrk/*txt</pre>
The source directory only uses up 3 MB but since I only have a 100 MB quota so I don't have room to leave things I don't need.
