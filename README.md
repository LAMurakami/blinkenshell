I have been part of the BlinkenShell community since October of 2016.

BlinkenShell offers Free Shell Accounts with a personal web space.
I run an AWS t3.nano instance rather than pay for a Supporter account.

One of the main uses for the BlinkenShell Free Shell Account is to
use an IRC client like irssi and run it in a screen on the shell.

This allows you to disconnect and connect again from a different computer,
protects your IRC session from unstable network connections, and
gets you past firewalls.
