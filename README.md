I have been part of the BlinkenShell community since October of 2016.

BlinkenShell offers Free Shell Accounts with a personal web space.
I run an AWS t3.nano instance rather than pay for a Supporter account.

One of the main uses for the BlinkenShell Free Shell Account is to
use an IRC client like irssi and run it in a screen on the shell.

This allows you to disconnect and connect again from a different computer,
protects your IRC session from unstable network connections, and
gets you past firewalls.
## GitLab and GitHub public Projects/Repositories
The
[gitlab.com/aws-lam/blinkenshell](https://gitlab.com/aws-lam/blinkenshell)
Project is a clone of the
[github.com/LAMurakami/blinkenshell](https://github.com/LAMurakami/blinkenshell)
Repostory.  My
[gitlab.com/LAMurakami](https://gitlab.com/LAMurakami)
account was created so that Projects can be cloned using https without
authentication over IPv6 as well as IPv4 unlike the
[github.com/LAMurakami](https://github.com/LAMurakami)
Repostories that can only be accessed over IPv6 with the
[IPv6 only workaround.](https://lamurakami.github.io/blog/2024/06/05/Access-GitHub-com-from-an-instance-without-a-public-IPv4-address.html)
