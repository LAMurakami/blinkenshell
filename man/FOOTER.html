<h1>man pages in html form for display by a browser</h1>
<h2>BlinkenShell user lam nickname The_One</h2>

This is the man subdirectory of the public_html directory of BlinkenShell user lam nickname The_One's ${HOME} directory.  

This directory contains documentation generated with <a href="http://ak17.lam1.us/man">man</a> and <a href="man2html">man2html</a>.  The html version is provided to be referenced by other documentation on this site.  The html man pages posted here may not reflect the same version that is currently installed on triton.
<p>
The pages are generated on the fly on my server in North Pole, Alaska by a perl Common gateway Interface (GCI) script.  If I paid <a href="http://blinkenshell.org/wiki/JohanMarcusson?action=show&redirect=independence">independence</a> a small monthly fee I could have GCI on this server as well.  For now this website is a "static" website except when I manually make changes.
