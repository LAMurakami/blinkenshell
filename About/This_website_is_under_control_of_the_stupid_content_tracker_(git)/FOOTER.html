<h2>I made ~lam/public_html a git repository on Sunday June 21, 2020</h2>

You could clone this on triton with:
<pre><a href="/man/git-clone">git clone</a> ~lam/public_html</pre>
You can examine the log on triton with:
<pre>cd ~lam/public_html
<a href="/man/git-log">git log</a></pre>
You can use git status|diff and other commands that require only read access.
<p>
At the current time the RCS archives remain because they have some
information on changes made before Sunday June 21, 2020.  I can't remember
if I had checked whether triton had git installed on it when I discovered
it did not have rcs.  I am over 65 and learned revision control long
before git came around.

<h2>Why now?</h2>
</center>
O.K. I only got around to getting this website is under control of git
Sunday June 21, 2020 but it's a tiny site using
less than 1/2 MB of space including the git repository.  I first used rcs
even though I had to build rcs on triton to use it.  The build was partly and
maybe even mostly to test my ability to build an application on triton but it
was also because rcs is often the first thing I look for when I want to put a
file under revision control.  When I get on a new Linux/Unix system I use it
to archive the .bashrc .bash_aliases and any other files I am going to change.
If I am administrator of a system I do the same thing for /etc files I change
to control the operational environment.
<p>
Once you want to control multiple files git is a much better revision control
system for a large variety of reasons.  The main reason is the commit which
can be for anything from changes addition or deletion of a single object to
a change affecting every object currently under it's control.
<p>
I still use rcs for a large part because I used it decades before git even
existed.  Although git has been around more than a decade, rcs was initially
released over 38 years ago when I was getting my Computer Science degree in my
earliest days of coding.  As of today, 1/3 of the time git has been around
is after I retired.

<h2>Something to do</h2>
</center>
There are a few reasons I am getting around to this today.  One is that one
of my main activities while practicing social distancing because of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic">COVID-19 pandemic</a> is
playing with web technology.  A related reason is me getting around to a
"Set up a GitHub Pages website" task I had added to my ToDo April 29, 2015
a few months before I retired from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_Region_Supercomputing_Center">
Arctic Region Supercomputing Center (ARSC)</a>
because it ceased to exist.  While worked for ARSC I worked on projects that
used git but none of those were uploaded to GitHub let alone any "public"
repository.  For most of the time I worked with git, a repository was a local
path (often on a shared filesystem mounted locally) or a system:path
combination.  In both cases it was the same argument that would work with
rsync.  I created my GitHub account as part of The Data Scientistâ€™s Toolbox
course from Johns Hopkins University which is a MOOC (Massive Open Online
Course) earlier in 2015.
<p>
So this site is one of many I decided to use git for revision control but it
was a little different in that I had already implemented a clone of the site.
The clone of the site is updated daily by a rsync job that uses this site as
the source.  The clone also creates a backup using tar that is updated during
a daily check if the content has changed.  This is the source used in the CloudInit directives when a new
LAM AWS EC2 instance is launched to take over hosting of the site.
<p>
The .htaccess file that has some Apache configuration directives for the
lam.blinkenshell.org site was already within the repo because of the way
<a href="https://blinkenshell.org/wiki/Info/Webhosting">web pages at BlinkenShell</a>
works.  I decided to move the
<a href="/blinkenshell_apache2.conf">Apache2 configuration file for the clone</a>
into the repo as well.  While I was at it I moved the
<a href="/blinkenshell_archive_rebuild.bash">blinkenshell_archive_rebuild</a> and
<a href="/blinkenshell_aws_rsync.bash">blinkenshell_aws_rsync</a>
scripts into the archive and updated some of the comments.
<p>
I then decided to create this page.
