The ability to post personal web pages at BlinkenShell
 is included in the Free Shell Accounts they offer.

Supporter</a></b> Accounts have a 1 GB quota.

<h2>I have given BlinkenShell users read access to ~lam/public_html</h2>
</center>

If you have a BlinkenShell Account you have read access to the DocumentRoot of this website at
~lam/public_html or /home/lam/public_html including the HEADER.html FOOTER.html and .htaccess files which are not listed in the above directory listing.  You also have access to the hidden RCS directory and rcs archives within.  The rcs command was not installed in my default path on triton when I got on and you can also access the rcs commands, info and help I built.  To do so you would modify your environment with the following:
<pre>PATH=${PATH}:~lam/bin ; export PATH
MANPATH=${MANPATH}:~lam/share/man ; export MANPATH
INFOPATH=${INFOPATH}:~lam/share/info ; export INFOPATH</pre>

Once you have executed the above you can access the commands and the documentation.  The rcs command has both a man page and info file that can be accessed with:
<pre>info rcs
man rcs</pre>

<center>
<h2>I built rcs on triton on 10/28/2016</h2>
</center>

If you want to see the output of the wget, tar, configure, make, and make install commands used to install rcs from source you can look at on triton it with:
<pre>less ~lam/src/rcs-5.9.4/wrk/*txt</pre>
The source directory only uses up 3 MB but since I only have a 100 MB quota so I don't have room to leave things I don't need.

<center>
<h2>I made ~lam/public_html a git repository on Sunday June 21, 2020</h2>
</center>
You could clone this on triton with:
<pre>git clone ~lam/public_html</pre>
You can examine the log on triton with:
<pre>cd ~lam/public_html
git log</pre>
You can use git status|diff and other commands that require only read access.
<p>
At the current time the RCS archives remain because they have some
information on changes made before Sunday June 21, 2020.  I can't remember
if I had checked whether triton had git installed on it when I discovered
it did not have rcs.  I am over 65 and learned revision control long
before git came around.

<b><a href="http://BlinkenShell.org/wiki/Info/Supporter"
 title="More details on Supporter accounts">

A BlinkenShell Supporter Account</a></b>
increases the Disk Quota to 1GB, supports a custom domain, allows dynamic web pages with PHP or CGI and MySQL and more but costs 300 Swedish Krona ($31.20 USD) per year.  I am running <a href="http://aws.lam1.us/About">an AWS server</a> for $17.00 / year plus storage and network costs.  The total costs based on my current usage is less than the BlinkenShell Supporter Account costs and the first year, starting December 2017, was part of the AWS Free-Tier.
<p>
As of Tuesday, May 19, 2020 I have had my BlinkenShell account for more than three years and at least one aws instance running for more than two years.
